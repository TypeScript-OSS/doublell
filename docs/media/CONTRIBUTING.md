Thank you for your interest in contributing to doublell! üéâ We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels and backgrounds. This guide will help you get started and ensure your contributions align with the project's goals.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/doublell.git`
3. **Install dependencies**: `yarn install`
4. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## üéØ Project Vision

doublell aims to be the **most type-safe, performant, and developer-friendly** doubly linked list implementation for TypeScript and JavaScript. Our core principles:

- **Type Safety First**: Comprehensive TypeScript support with full generic typing
- **Performance**: O(1) operations where possible, minimal memory overhead
- **Developer Experience**: Familiar APIs, comprehensive documentation, great tooling support
- **Reliability**: High test coverage, robust error handling
- **AI-Friendly**: Rich type information and documentation for AI coding assistants

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14.14+ (we recommend using the latest LTS version)
- Yarn package manager
- TypeScript knowledge (for most contributions)

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TypeScript-OSS/doublell.git
cd doublell

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run tests to ensure everything works
yarn test

# Generate documentation
yarn generate:docs
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Run tests
yarn test                           # Full test suite
yarn test:unit-tests               # Just unit tests
yarn test:check-circular-dependencies  # Check for circular deps

# Code quality
yarn lint                          # Run ESLint
yarn lint --fix                   # Fix linting issues

# Build
yarn build                         # Production build
yarn build:dev                    # Development build

# Documentation
yarn generate:docs                 # Generate TypeDoc documentation

# Cleanup
yarn clean                         # Remove build artifacts
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

We maintain **high test coverage** (currently >97%) and expect all contributions to include appropriate tests.

### Test Requirements
- **Unit tests** for all new methods/functionality
- **Edge case coverage** (empty lists, single items, error conditions)
- **Type safety tests** ensuring TypeScript generics work correctly
- **Integration tests** for complex interactions

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('YourFeature', () => {
  it('should handle the basic case', () => {
    const list = new DoubleLinkedList<number>(1, 2, 3);
    // Test basic functionality
    expect(list.yourMethod()).toBe(expectedResult);
  });

  it('should handle edge cases', () => {
    const emptyList = new DoubleLinkedList<number>();
    // Test edge cases
    expect(emptyList.yourMethod()).toBeUndefined();
  });

  it('should maintain type safety', () => {
    const stringList = new DoubleLinkedList<string>('a', 'b');
    const result = stringList.yourMethod();
    // TypeScript should infer correct types
    expect(typeof result).toBe('string');
  });
});
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
yarn test:unit-tests --watch

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test:unit-tests --coverage
```

## üìù Code Style and Standards

We maintain consistent code quality through automated tooling:

### TypeScript Standards
- **Strict mode** enabled - no `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- **Full generic typing** - leverage TypeScript's type system
- **JSDoc comments** for all public APIs
- **Immutable interfaces** where appropriate (readonly properties)

### Code Formatting
- **ESLint** with Prettier integration
- **No warnings allowed** - the build fails on ESLint warnings
- **Consistent naming**: camelCase for methods, PascalCase for classes
- **Arrow functions** for class methods (enables proper `this` binding)

### Documentation Standards
```typescript
/**
 * Brief description of what the method does.
 * More detailed explanation if needed.
 * 
 * @param param1 - Description of the parameter
 * @param param2 - Description with type info
 * @returns Description of return value
 * @complexity O(1) or O(n) - performance characteristics
 * 
 * @example Basic usage
 * ```typescript
 * const list = new DoubleLinkedList(1, 2, 3);
 * const result = list.yourMethod(param1, param2);
 * console.log(result); // Expected output
 * ```
 * 
 * @example Edge case
 * ```typescript
 * const emptyList = new DoubleLinkedList<string>();
 * const result = emptyList.yourMethod();
 * console.log(result); // undefined
 * ```
 */
public readonly yourMethod = (param1: Type1, param2: Type2): ReturnType => {
  // Implementation
};
```
